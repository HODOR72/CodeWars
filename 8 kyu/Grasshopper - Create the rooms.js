// Escape the room
// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

var rooms = {
  name: {
    a: 'a',
    b: 'b',
    c: 'c',
  },
  description: {
    a: 'a',
    b: 'b',
    c: 'c',
  },
  completed: {
    a: true,
    b: false,
    c: false,
  }
}
